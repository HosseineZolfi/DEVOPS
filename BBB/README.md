# Bacula Deployment with Docker

This repository provides a setup for deploying **Bacula** — an open-source backup solution — using Docker. The configuration files in this repository define the setup for the Bacula Director (bacula-dir), Bacula File Daemon (bacula-fd), and Bacula Storage Daemon (bacula-sd), as well as the orchestration of the entire environment using Docker Compose.

## Overview

Bacula is a set of programs to manage backup, recovery, and verification of data across a network of computers. It offers enterprise-level backup features and supports a variety of storage devices.

This setup includes the following components:

- **Bacula Director (bacula-dir)**: The central component of Bacula that manages backup jobs, schedules, and configurations.
- **Bacula File Daemon (bacula-fd)**: A component that runs on the client machine and facilitates communication with the Director to back up and restore data.
- **Bacula Storage Daemon (bacula-sd)**: Manages backup storage devices (like tapes or disk storage).
- **Docker Compose**: Used to define and run multi-container Docker applications for Bacula services.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of the following files:

### 1. **bacula-dir.conf**
   - **Description**: Configuration file for the Bacula Director. It defines the Director’s settings, including job definitions, storage configuration, client configuration, and scheduling.
   - **Usage**: Configure this file to manage the backup processes, schedule jobs, and specify the network settings for Bacula.

### 2. **bacula-fd.conf**
   - **Description**: Configuration file for the Bacula File Daemon. It specifies the settings for the client machine, including the Director's address, storage daemon, and the files to be backed up.
   - **Usage**: Customize this file to match the client environment where backups need to be executed.

### 3. **bacula-sd.conf**
   - **Description**: Configuration file for the Bacula Storage Daemon. It contains information about backup storage devices and pool management.
   - **Usage**: Set up storage locations, backup media pools, and define device configurations here.

### 4. **docker-compose.yaml**
   - **Description**: Docker Compose configuration file that orchestrates the Bacula Director, File Daemon, and Storage Daemon containers. It simplifies the deployment of Bacula services in a Docker environment.
   - **Usage**: Use this file to deploy and manage the Bacula services within Docker containers.
