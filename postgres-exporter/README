first of all install postgres sql database in your vm:

apt-get install postgressql -y

before running this docker compose make sure that postgres sql database is installed in your system and then move and change this  options from this files:
-----------
1-vim /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf:
uncomment this option(listen_addresses) and replace with this:
listen_addresses = '*'
-----------
2-vim /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf:
look for "# IPv4 local connections:" inside this file below this line:
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256

insert this line:
host    all             all             YOURIP/32            scram-sha-256

for example the final output must be like this:
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    all             all             185.79.97.94/32            scram-sha-256

then restart postgres.service
after that you must add the job of postgres-exporter to your prometheus.yaml config file like this:

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'postgres-exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['185.79.97.94:9187']

after your postgres exporter started you can test your connection with this command:
curl http://localhost:9187/metrics
note:
if your exporter didnt fetch data correctly from promethues check your user and password inside the docker compose file
you can connect your database using this command:
1-su postgres
2-psql -U postgres -h YOURIP -p 5432
inside the postgres sql:
3-ALTER USER yourusername WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
