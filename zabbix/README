To monitor other servers, you need to install the Zabbix Agent on those systems.
On the target server, install the Zabbix Agent:

sudo apt install zabbix-agent
sudo nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf

Server=your_zabbix_server_ip
ServerActive=your_zabbix_server_ip
Hostname=your_server_hostname

sudo systemctl start zabbix-agent
sudo systemctl enable zabbix-agent

Once Zabbix Agent is installed and configured on your servers, you can add those servers as hosts in the Zabbix frontend.

In the Zabbix frontend, go to Configuration > Hosts.
Click Create Host.
Enter the hostname, IP address, and assign the appropriate group for the server.
Under Agent Interfaces, configure the IP and port 10050 (default Zabbix Agent port).
Save the configuration and wait for Zabbix to start monitoring the host.

Go to Configuration > Actions to create and configure alerting rules.
Define triggers for events like high CPU usage, memory usage, etc.
Configure actions for sending notifications (email, Slack, etc.).

Go to Monitoring > Graphs to create custom graphs based on the metrics you want to monitor (e.g., CPU usage, disk space).
You can create custom dashboards that display key metrics in a visual format.
